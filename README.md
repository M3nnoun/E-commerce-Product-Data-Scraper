- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
3. Open the `scraper.py` file and update the list of product URLs you want to scrape in the `product_urls` list.
4. Customize the scraping logic in the `scrape_product_data` function to match the structure of the target website. You can extract more data if needed.
5. Run the scraper:

6. The scraped data will be saved in a file named `product_data.csv` in the same directory.

### Note
