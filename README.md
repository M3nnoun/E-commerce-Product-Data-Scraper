# E-commerce Product Data Scraper

This Python script is designed to scrape product data from the Luxury Drip e-commerce website. It can extract information such as product names, prices, sizes, and color options. The scraped data is saved in a CSV file for further analysis or use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following Python libraries:

- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `scraper.py` file and replace the `HTML_NAV_BAR` variable's content with the HTML code for the navigation bar from the Luxury Drip website. This code is used to extract category names and links.

3. Customize the scraping logic in the `get_product_info` function to match the structure of the Luxury Drip product pages. You can modify the code to extract additional information if needed.

4. Run the scraper:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

5. The scraped data will be saved in a file named `products.csv` in the `luxury-drip` directory.

### Note

- This scraper is specific to the Luxury Drip e-commerce website. To use it for a different website, you will need to adapt the code to match the structure and classes of that website.
- Be sure to read and adhere to the website's terms of use and policies. Some websites may prohibit or restrict web scraping.
- The script includes a 10-second delay between category requests (`time.sleep(10)`) to prevent overloading the website's server.
